Notifications are important but often annoying for laymen to configure and some apps may have mediocre or difficult to search documentation.

So we can just put it all here and make life easier for our friends who don't read manuals and aren't developers.

## What are notifications?

Notifications can take several forms, and it depends on what platform you're using. At their root, they're some sort of communication to you from an application that doesn't currently have your attention.

Windows 10 has notifications in the lower right, next to the time and date in your tray. They pop-up around there, too. Also, Windows can flash icons in the taskbar that want your attention, this is often also called blinking.

On Linux, each system has its own. GNOME/XFCE Notifications, KDE's Plasma notifications, etc. Most of these systems have some method of flashing items in the taskbar, depending on the taskbar you use, which may also be refered to as blinking or an urgent notification.

Mac notifications appear in the upper right and it can also make taskbar icons bounce for attention.

Browsers have a system called "desktop notifications" which allows a website to utilize your operating system's notification system (or a custom one by the browser, however the browser works) while it's currently open in your browser, regardless of whether or not its tab is in focus. Websites can, of course, use other means of notifying you, such as by email. Browsers also typically have an indicator over one of the menus when there's an update to install or something of that nature.

Android has several forms of notifications, such as "push notifications", which appear in the pull-down menu at the top (and typically have an icon when not pulled down), and also "toast notifications" which appear for a short time near the bottom of the screen, over top of other apps. Phones may do other things to notify you, such as vibrate, flash a light, or make a noise.

iPhone has its own notification systems but I don't have one and I don't want to look it up!
